# C Hash Tables

This directory contains C programs implementing hash tables, a fundamental data structure used for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Learning Objectives

By exploring the contents of this directory, you will gain knowledge and understanding of the following concepts:

- What is a hash function and its properties
- Characteristics of a good hash function
- The structure and functionality of hash tables
- Collision handling techniques in hash tables
- Advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
- Common use cases of hash tables in computer science

## Contents

1. **hash_tables.h**: This header file contains the structure definitions for `hash_node_t` and `hash_table_t`, which represent nodes in the hash table and the hash table itself, respectively.

2. **hash_tables.c**: This source file contains implementations for functions related to hash table operations, such as initialization, insertion, retrieval, and deletion.

3. **main.c**: This source file contains a sample program demonstrating the usage of the hash table implementation. It includes examples of inserting, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs from the hash table.

## Usage

To use the provided hash table implementation in your C programs, follow these steps:

1. Include the `hash_tables.h` header file in your source files where hash table functionality is needed.

2. Compile your program along with `hash_tables.c` using your preferred C compiler.

3. Link any necessary libraries if using external functions or data structures.

4. Use the provided functions to perform hash table operations such as insertion, retrieval, and deletion.
